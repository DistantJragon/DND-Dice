# DND-Dice
Canvas "Game" for rolling the dice seen in DND

Running online:

   Go to https://distantjragon.github.io/DND-Dice/

Running locally:
  
   Windows:
   
    Download all the files and run the “index.html” file.

  Android: 
  
    Download all the files 
    Open “file:///sdcard/” or open “file:///storage/” in a browser depending on where your stored them. 
      (They might be switched :/)
    Navigate to wherever you saved the files (downloads?) and then find the “index.html” file and run it.
      (You can bookmark the page and it will bring you back to the program as long as you don’t move the files)
      (Or save it to your home screen)

  iOS: 
  
    I don’t think you can run local files on iOS without 3rd party apps.

When changes are applied to the code, you will have to at least redownload code.js for changes to be applied. 
Sometimes the whole D&D Dice folder will have to be redownloaded.
